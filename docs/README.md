# memeid

`memeid` is a Scala library for generating [RFC-compliant](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) Universal Unique Identifiers (UUIDs).

> A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems.
>
> When generated according to the standard methods, UUIDs are for practical purposes unique. Their uniqueness does not depend on a central registration authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most other numbering schemes.
-- [Wikipedia article on UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)

## Rationale

The UUID type that ships with the JVM `java.util.UUID` has a number of problems, namely:

 - A bug in the comparison function that will never be fixed https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7025832
 - Only provides UUID generation for random (V4) and non-namespaced pseudo-V3 UUIDs

This library aims to solve the aforementioned issues and provide an RFC-compliant `UUID` type with coherent comparison, a rich API to get its different fields and constructors for the UUID variants.

## UUID construction

### Time-based (v1)

The time-based (V1) variant of UUIDs is the fastest to generate. It uses a monotonic clock and node information to generate UUIDs.

```scala mdoc
import memeid.UUID

UUID.V1.next
UUID.V1.next
UUID.V1.next
```

### Random (v4)

The cryptographically random variant, equivalent to `java.util.UUID/randomUUID`.

```scala mdoc
import memeid.UUID

UUID.V4.random
UUID.V4.random
UUID.V4.random
```

### Namespaced (v3, v5)

Namespaced UUIDs are generated from a UUID (namespace) and a hashed value (name), V3 uses MD5 and V5 uses SHA1 hash.

```scala mdoc
import memeid.UUID

val namespace = UUID.V1.next

UUID.V3(namespace, "my-secret-code")
UUID.V5(namespace, "my-secret-code")
```

### Semi-sequential, random (SQUUID)

SQUUIDs are a non-standard variaton of V4 UUIDs that are semi-sequential. They incorporate a time-component in their 32 most significant bits to generate UUIDs that don't fragment DB indexes.

```scala mdoc
import memeid.UUID

UUID.V4.squuid
UUID.V4.squuid
UUID.V4.squuid
```
